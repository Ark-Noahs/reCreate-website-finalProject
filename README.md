# reCreate-website-finalProject
This program is for a final project in which we were to view an existing website and take inspiration from it. To then make our own version of it while following copyright guidelines.

This program got inspiration from the clothing brand supreme based out of New York. 
It is a street wear clothing line that gained a massive following at the start of the 21st century. 
Per the instructors guidelines, this website was not to have any form of code that accepted payment or asked the user for personal information.
In her words "anything that would resembles a checkout option and any steps that followed from selecting checkout"
The purpose of this project isnt to make an identical website but instead to try and experiment with/try different features.
