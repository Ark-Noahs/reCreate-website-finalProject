                The brand was founded by James Jebbia in 1994. During the brand's inception, Jebbia drew inspiration from a book about Barbara Kruger for the logo. The first Supreme store debuted in an old office space on Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan in April 1994. Jebbia's choice to establish Supreme in Lower Manhattan was rooted in the absence of available skate products in the area at that time. Supreme garnered attention for its limited releases, iconic designs, and unconventional collaborations with other brands.

                What set Supreme apart was its celebrity partnerships, where notable figures would be photographed wearing Supreme box logo shirts. These shirts would then be produced and sold at the beginning of each season. Recognizable names like Lady Gaga, Kermit the Frog, and Mike Tyson have all played a role in contributing to Supreme's growth over the years. In recent times, the brand has expanded its footprint globally, boasting 15 stores around the world with more in the pipeline.
